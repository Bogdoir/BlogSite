				<h2>Chapter 1 - Little Puppy</h2>
				<p>Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a little, wide-eyed puppy. He had a faded black coat, more grey than black really, and with little white strands of hair brushing through. His eyes, dark green, the colour of unrefined emeralds. And his wee paws! Quite surprisingly, they were quite neatly kept, despite all the lengthy adventures he had been on.</p>
				<p>He loved to travel, far and far he would go, each day a new adventure! But this little puppy, wide-eyed and full of curiosity... he always felt small, tiny and not very useful. He would look up at bigger things and yearn to be big like them. He would see other dogs when he was out, standing high over him. And big cats with their stuck up expressions as they passed him by. And those tall naked things that wore fake fur... what were they called again? Oh yes, humans. They were very tall, despite their peculiar look about them.</p>
				<p>The little puppy would also see many pretty birds, and although most were smaller than him, they had huge, powerful, beautiful wings that allowed them to fly, soaring through the bright blue sky, higher than anything he had ever seen. He loved to gaze out into the busy world, watching it pass by. Watching and only wishing he was big enough to mean something, to become a part of the wondrous world he loved so dearly.</p>
				<p>So that is what he did. Have a problem? Find a solution! He wanted to be big? Easy, just get bigger! Simple. He knew his idea was flawless. So he went about his way to get bigger! He stood up on his four legs, gazed at the now, cloud-filled sky and thought to himself, really, really hard. "Grow, grow... grow!" he mumbled under his breath. After three whole minutes of thought and self-motivation, he lowered his head back down, looking towards the ground and then looking lower towards his legs, his tail wagging with excitement.</p>
				<p>Suddenly, his excitement died, his tail stopped moving. His legs are the same... he could still boop the ground with his nose as he did by leaning forward ever so slightly. He didn't seem to have grown at all. This little puppy began to feel so sad and useless once again. Then, all of a sudden, a red squirrel of near equal size to him, scurried passed him, gave him a glare in his eyes and then scurried off, climbing quickly up a nearby tree. He couldn't even do that, climb trees... that squirrel, although small, had the view of a giant! The puppy decided it wasn't worth thinking about anymore and decided to go for a walk.</p>

				<h2>Chapter 2 - The Forbidden Forest</h2>
				<p>An hour into his carefree walk, he came across a large, lush forest on the edge of town. He had seen this forest before but never had he entered. The local human things had put up strong posts and fences, dividing their town from the forest. He hadn't thought about what was beyond before, he would have just turned around and went elsewhere.</p>
				<p>But not this time. "Why did they fence this forest off?", he wondered. "What was so special about this place? Is it to keep things out or to keep things in? Is this a dangerous place or a place to protect?". So many questions rushing through his mind. He had wished he could ask someone but sadly, he did not speak human and all the other creatures of the town didn't come this far. He was on his own to find the answers. So that was what he decided to do!</p>
				<p>He ran along the old, worn fence, this fence had a stone base and strong timbers closing all the gaps. It may have been old and worn but it certainly wasn't a joke. This was some serious craftsmanship for such an out of place structure. He kept trying to find a way through and at last, he had found a small gap under the stones, still too small to fit through, but with his perfect size, it became a treasure.</p>
				<p>Using his clean paws, he dug out the hole a little wider and managed to pull his way through. Black and covered with dirt now, he shook himself off, hardly making much difference, and began to walk towards the wooded lands. His tail wagging as he did.</p>
				<p>After hours of exploring, the forest didn't seem to have an end. Luckily, the puppy had an excellent sense of direction, he always knew his way back and he never got lost. This gave him the confidence to walk as far as he could before the sun began to set.</p>
				<p>Hours later, the day was, indeed, coming to an end. Faster than expected. The puppy hadn't explored a forest this deep and for this long before. The trees blocked out the little sunlight there was in the forest and it soon fell into darkness. He suddenly became fearful of the night, speeding up his steps, his eyes getting wider, looking for things he recognised. He ran, lost in the forest.</p>
				<p>But wait! What's that? A glitter in the distance. Fading in and out. It had caught his eye and all of a sudden he found himself swiftly walking towards it, not confident enough to run but certainly aware enough to get there quickly.</p>
				<p>As he became closer, the glitter of light began to illuminate its surroundings. "A tree? No. A stack of trees? Not quite..." he questioned... he had never seen a structure like this before. He couldn't quite tell if it had grown out from the forest or was made by something. A pile of logs on top of one another and held together with larger logs, the gaps packed and insulated with moss. He then saw where the glitter of light was coming from. A candle being held up by a branch sticking out from this unusual structure.</p>
				<p>He began to crawl, slowly creeping around the side of this object... he saw what looks to be a sort of door! He had recognised this, of course. The humans of his town had doors like this made from fallen trees. "This must be some sort of ancient human building" he quietly murmured.</p>
				<p>**CRACK**</p>
				<p>The puppy freaked! A sound from the darkness of the forest echoed through his ears. He quickly ran towards the door of the building and pushed up against it with his paws and small stature and to his surprise, it narrowly creaked open. He squeezed between the gap of the door and ran inside. Scurrying to find some place to hide. He found some wool-like cloths on the ground and climbed himself under them.</p>
				<p>Quietly, he hid, listening cautiously. The source of the sound came closer. He could hear it quite clearly now. Leaves bustling, sticks snapping. It was some kind of creature. Slowly stepping towards the door, only to stop suddenly in place. Seemingly suspicious about something... after a moment, it continued walking, pushing open the old, creaky door. The puppy, still in his hiding spot, could see the figure as it walked in. It was a human!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Chapter" id="Chapter3">
				<h2>Chapter 3 - The Human</h2>
				<p>It wore a dark green cloak with a hood covering its face, it had tall, brown, worn boots. It's body had a very neatly designed cloth on it, a faded blue with a black pattern spiralling from it's centre. It's legs wearing some kind of dark blue fur. This human looked very warm and well prepared for the dark and cold of the forest.</p>
				<p>While admiring this human, he forgot to pay attention to what it was doing. It's head turning and scanning the room, still suspicious of something. "The door..." he whined to himself. He had left it open when he came in. Suddenly the shadowy figure turned towards him, hearing his low whine he couldn't hold in from the fear. The human grabbed a very decorated stick with beautiful carvings from the doorway and walked over towards him, seemingly cautious.</p>
				<p>The little puppy tried crawling backwards but quickly felt the wall behind him. He was trapped. The dark figure of a human, suddenly becoming darker as it's body blocks out more and more light from the entrance. It leaned forward towards the wool-like cloths on the floor and quickly grabbed them, pulling them away.</p>
				<p>It then saw him, the puppy, laying there, shivering with fear. The human, now knowing the puppy wasn't a threat, stepped back again towards the light, stood up tall and pulled back it's hood, revealing its face to the puppy. This human was a girl!</p>
				<p>She looked down towards him in the corner and smiled slightly, she had dark hair and a sweet smile. She whispered softly to the little puppy, "Hey, hey little one, what are you doing down there?" she chuckled afterwards. "Are you lost? I haven't seen a puppy like you for years, it looks like you've travelled far, haven't you?".</p>
				<p>The puppy, not understanding her could feel her warm words caress his ears. He began to calm down and lay down in the corner, no longer shaking as violently. The girl stepped back, giving the puppy some space. "It's a cold night tonight, isn't it little one? I hope you don't mind me closing the door, brrrrr".</p>
				<p>She went over and brought in the little candle that was brightening up the doorway and closed the door. She placed the candle on a lovely table, full of pretty notches and knots. After a moment, she fully let her guard back down too and started making herself comfortable, grabbing some logs and placing them onto a small smouldering fire in the corner of the room.</p>
				<p>A minute or two later, the fire was burning brightly and it filled the room with a replenishing heat. The human girl stood back from the fire and took off her long green cloak, revealing her long hair. It was beautiful. It was the longest hair that he had ever seen on a human before.</p>
				<p>The girl then hung her cloak up beside the doorway and then sat on a soft blanket covering what looked to be a bed. "Come here, little one", she said softly yet confidently. "Come on, let's get you all warmed up!". Her warm voice alone had already reassured the little puppy. He stood up, still slightly nervous, and crawled over beside the bed.</p>
				<p>She then reached out her arms to the puppy and waited for the puppy to climb into them. The puppy wasn't so sure... he backed away again beside the fire. The girl understood and pulled out a carpet and laid down on the floor with the puppy, bringing her down to his level. "You've had a long day, haven't you, little one?". The puppy hearing her soft voice again, gave in and fell down completely to the ground beside her, warming himself by the fire.</p>
				<p>"Here, lay on this", she said while shuffling over a little bit and gesturing to the warm carpet. The puppy crawled over and laid down, trying hard not to fall asleep. The girl sat up and looked into the fire. She started to sing some kind of ancient songs... lullabies. She reached out her hand again and stroked from his head and down his back. A few minutes later the puppy fell right to sleep. The girl, smiling to herself, "I'll see you in the morning, little one", she whispered. "Goodnight".</p>

				<h2>Chapter 4 - Jack</h2>
				<p>A bright light began to cover the puppy's face. A consistent light. It wasn't the fire anymore. His eyes began to open begrudgingly, still tired. A few moments passed and he stood up, gazing around the room. It was morning! The entire world was different, this wooden building appeared to be a house, a warm, cosy, beautiful home. It even had windows! They appeared to be made from a kind of wavy glass.</p>
				<p>Quickly, he looked down, almost forgetting about the girl. She was still asleep, laying down, still on the carpet she had laid out last night. She stayed with him all night. He could now see her face clearly, she looked beautiful. He noticed she had a scar between her eyes. Even a scar wouldn't affect her beauty. The puppy, after scanning the room ambiently, still tired from the night before, crawled up against the girl. Feeling his touch, the girl pulled out her arm and hugged the little puppy, still with her eyes closed.</p>
				<p>Some time after, the girl leaned up and stretched, feeling refreshed. The puppy with those few minutes more also felt ready for the day. The girl stood up and walked to the other end of the room. "Want some breakfast, little one?" she asked. A happy little "Woof!" came from the puppy, now wagging his tail. The girl smiled.</p>
				<p>"Okay then!", she said to him, "Let me get something ready!". She opened up a box in the wall, it had grains of salt in the bottom and a dry breeze of air coming from below, probably coming from outside to keep it cool. There was meat in there and eggs and a few vegetables but not many. She then took out some of the meat and two eggs, placed them onto a tall table, turned around, opened up a cupboard and took out half a loaf of brown bread.</p>
				<p>She walked back over to the fire, smouldering once again, she placed some more logs and stoked it up. A few seconds later, it was burning again. She placed over the fire a pot of water and placed in the eggs. She then laid the meat she took out along a rack and rested it near the fire. "Breakfast will be ready soon, little one!" she said, happily.</p>
				<p>A few minutes later, she took the, now boiled, eggs from the fire and shortly after she took the meat. She placed the two eggs onto a wooden plate for herself with the delicious brown meat. Cutting off a slice of bread, she finishes her breakfast. She then places the rest of the meat onto a second plate. Picking up the plates, she walks back over to the fire and sits down on the carpet.</p>
				<p>Sitting next to the little puppy, she places his breakfast on the floor for him. "Eat up, little one!" she says, happily while she begins to eat her own breakfast. "We need a name for you!", she said, while biting the bread. "You may be little but what else shall I call you? Pupper... Doggo... how about John? Or Henry, just some human names.. or Jack? Oh yeah! Jack! Hey little Jack!".</p>
				<p>The puppy, still clueless to what she was saying just loved listening to the sound of her soft voice as he ate his breakfast. "Hey Jack, come here!" she said, raising her voice. The little puppy saw that she was excited but wasn't sure why. "Jackkkkk, Jackkkk, oh little Jackkkk" she repeated. The puppy, still confused.</p>
				<p>After eating breakfast, the girl jumped up and brought her plate over to a box of water and washed it. "Jack!" she said again, as the little puppy finishes his meat, he began to realise she was saying Jack when she wanted his attention. The little puppy walked over to her, looking up at her with his big wide-eyes.</p>
				<p>"Hello there little, Jack!" she said to him, softly. "Let's go outside for a walk." she said while gesturing towards the door. The puppy, still unsure what this girl was saying was starting to pick up what she was saying, she had named him, he never had a name before. She wanted him to go outside with her. The little puppy, accepting his new name and wagging his tail, ran towards the door, the puppy, or well, Jack, felt right at home.</p>
				<p>His dream to be big wasn't on his mind anymore, "Perhaps one day", he thought one more time. He gave this girl joy, even at his small size and he felt so useful. "Come, little Jack!" the girl called from the door as she put on her tall, brown boots. "Let's go!".</p>
